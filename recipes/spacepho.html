    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is a quaint recipe originating from a place far, far away. During a typical Space Force excursion on Jupiter,
        expert Pho cook Jordan Pedersen (Not to be confused with Jordan Peterson) accidentally created the world's first Pho recipe
        in space, hence the name - Space Pho!

    <h2>Things you will need, going forward...</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces of loin beef</li>
        <li>3 cubes of beef broth of congruent size and shape</li>
        <li>5 cups of orange juice. 3 will work if you don't have enough on hand.</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of salt</li>
        <li>Angel hair pasta</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Let us begin satiating the beast within us...</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, throw in your angel hair pasta and douse it generously with orange juice. Toss the 3d beef squares in.</li>
        <li>Turn the stove-top to "VERY high" and pour the salt and garlic powder in while you stir. </li>
        <li>Once the beef has assimilated with the orange juice, you are ready to turn the heat down to "medium"</li>
        <li>Set a timer for ten minutes. Get ready to toss the loin beef in</li>
        <li>Yep, it's time to do it. Throw the beef in and keep on stirring. Do this for another 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Having wisely followed these instructions to the letter, it's time to enjoy the fruits of your labor!</li>
